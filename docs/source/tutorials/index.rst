Tutorials
=========

In this section, we provide hands-on examples of how to use Magnos. The tutorials cover:

* **Tutorial 1** - a basic working example of a 1D ferromagnetic chain. Introduces the ASE Atoms, Magnos InteractionList and Magnos MagnonSpectrum classes.
* **Tutorial 2** - demonstrates the symmetrization routine available to generate fully-symmetrized interaction data under the unit cell symmetry operations.
* **Tutorial 3** - demonstrates building primitive cells and using SeeK-path to choose a suitable path in reciprocal space
* **Tutorial 4** - uses input files rather than building a structure and its interactions by hand
